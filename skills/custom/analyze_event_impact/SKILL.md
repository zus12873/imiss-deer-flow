# analyze_event_impact

Use this Skill on CityBench evidence or regional activity evidence. It compares treatment and control regions around an event window with a simplified DID-style calculation.

## Command

```bash
cd /mnt/skills/custom/analyze_event_impact
python3 scripts/analyze_event_impact.py \
  --input /path/to/evidence.jsonl \
  --output-dir /path/to/output \
  --event-start 2012-06-09T00:00:00 \
  --event-end 2012-06-10T00:00:00 \
  --treatment-geohash wtw1z,wtw3s \
  --event-name "大型活动影响"
```

## Outputs

- `region_impacts.jsonl`
- `summary.json`
- `viz_input.jsonl`

## Algorithm

- Treatment/control split
- Event-window comparison
- Welch-style t statistic
- DID estimate where controls are available
- Landmark-enriched impact evidence

## Next Skills

Use event-impact outputs with `$fuse_spatial_evidence`, or pair them with hotspot/anomaly results for causal interpretation.
